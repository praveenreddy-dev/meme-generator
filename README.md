# Meme Generator

A simple meme generator web application that fetches memes from the [Meme_Api](https://github.com/D3vd/Meme_Api) API. The application allows users to enter a subreddit name, and upon clicking the "Generate Meme" button, it fetches a random meme from the specified subreddit and displays it along with the title and author.

## Getting Started

To use this meme generator, follow the steps below:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

`git clone https://github.com/your-username/meme-generator.git`

2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

3. Enter the subreddit name in the input field provided.

4. Click the "Generate Meme" button to fetch a random meme from the specified subreddit.

> **Note**: The first API response might be slow due to network latency. If you don't see a meme immediately after clicking the "Generate Meme" button, try clicking it again. Subsequent meme requests should load faster.
